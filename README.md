# Passenger Pickup and Dropoff Facilities: Throughput Capacity Evaluation

Passenger pickup and drop-off facilities are important to facilitate transportation to and from schools, sports facilities, and intermodal terminals such as airports and train stations. With the emergence and development of ride-hailing and good delivery services, pickup and drop-off activities have increased dramatically in the urban context. The current practice of curbside pickups and drop-offs has led to additional disruption and congestion for the road traffic, thus creating an urgent and growing need for more carefully designed pickup and drop-off facilities. 

We are a team of researchers aiming to develop strategies and computational tools to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different layout designs, which informs the practitioners and policymakers and aids the decision-making for pickup and drop-off facility design in various applications. In this repo, we share the implementation for the stochastic models and microscopic simulation for throughput capacity evaluation of pickup and dropoff facilities in several common layout configurations, with a desire to contribute an effective tool for practitioners and researchers. In our preprint (more information to come), we discuss the motivation, the literature, the model details, as well as a thorough analysis of numerical results. We apreciate you citing it as

In another repo, we included the implementation for a microscopic simulation that calculates the throughput capacity for aiport pickup and dropoff facilities. The repo can be accessed at https://github.com/cindylxyxy/PickupDropoffFacility/blob/main/README.md and a journal paper that thoroughly discusses this application to airports can be accessed at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03611981211037544
